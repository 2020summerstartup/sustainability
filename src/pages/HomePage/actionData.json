That leaves 38 billion water bottles in landfills. \n Plastic bottles take 700 years before they begin to decompose in a landfill."

It’s no surprise, then, that major rivers all around the world carry some 1.15-2.41 million tons of plastic into our seas each year. But you can make an effort to reverse this harrowing trend by moving toward eco-conscious, reusable straws as alternatives."

Recycling plastic bags often costs more than it is worth and so, many recycling facilities will not take them, meaning they end up in landfills. Disposable plastic bags are often flimsy and break easily, whereas reusable bags are more durable and can carry more without breaking."
