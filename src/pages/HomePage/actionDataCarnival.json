This is creating more and more electronic waste and with the lack of responsible recycling, the environmental issues of e-waste are continually increasing. Computers and most electronics contain toxic materials such as lead, zinc, nickel, flame retardants, barium, and chromium. Specifically with lead, if released into the environment can cause damage to human blood, kidneys, as well as central and peripheral nervous systems. When e-waste is warmed up, toxic chemicals are released into the air damaging the atmosphere. "
